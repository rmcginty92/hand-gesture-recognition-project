# Hand Gesture Recognition Project

## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

An increasingly impactful part of everyday life is how we interact with our technological devices most notably our computers. Much of the ingenuity stemming from human computer interaction research focuses only on improving current mainstream devices out there today. Only a few modes of Human-Computer interaction exist today: namely through keyboards, mouses, touch screens, and other handheld helper devices. Each of these devices has been confronted with their own limitations when adapting to more powerful and versatile hardware in computers.

A commonality between the issues of these devices are this: providing an intuitive mode of human-computer interaction cheaply without the additive of extra devices. With that said, we felt there were ways we could build an intuitive gesture control mode of human control interaction without the need to necessarily build another device. When tackling this problem of  creating a new mode of human-computer interaction we knew we could utilize a combination of built in functions that is typically p provided in most computer designs. Specifically we have exploited the built in webcam that has become a standard feature in most computers. This feature provides us a way to track and respond user hand free movements and gestures.

Using a combination object detection and recognition, the following project successfully builds a computationally inexpensive static hand-gesture recognition system using a simple RGB webcam.

## Installation

#### OS & Hardware
This program was developed in an lubuntu 14.04 OS on a DE2i-150 FPGA Development Kit (link below), which houses both an Intel embedded N2600 processor and an Altera Cyclone IV GX FPGA. This program, however, can run on any flavor of Ubuntu. While it has not yet been tested, this program can probably be used in other linux distrobutions as well.


####Libraries:
We did rely on key data structures from openCV and as such, it is required that OpenCV (specifically OpenCV Version 2.4.x) is available on your linux computer. Below there will be a link to the OpenCV download page as well as a link to an installation guide.
